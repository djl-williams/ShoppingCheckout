This is a repository for the supermarket checkout application. 

To extend this application further we can refactor by adding repository classes for items and special offers, then update Checkout.cs to use these repositories rather than direct lists. Then we can add new items and offers into each repository.
We can refactor the tests by adding mock implementations of the repositories.
